  Example usages:
  * Track job applications
  * Overview of pending, rejected and accepted internship applications you have
  * All so you will never miss interviews or offer acceptance deadlines!

* As a group of Year 2 Computing Students, school takes too much of our attention and there is a possibility of
  forgetting about internship application follow-ups and interviews that we may have.
* This app is designed to help students to track their internship applications amidst the heavy internship-hunting season.
