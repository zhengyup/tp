## **Introduction**

![Ui](images/Ui.png)

_LetsGetHired_ is a **desktop application** designed to assist you in efficiently **tracking and managing your 
internship applications and their progress**.

With _LetsGetHired_, you can benefit from:
- **Swift Viewing**: Swiftly view your internship applications and monitor their status.
- **Status Updates**: Stay updated on the progress of each application, from application sent to interview stages.
- **Organization**: Organize your internship applications according to your needs for better clarity.
- **Notes**: Add personalized notes to each internship application, ensuring you never forget key details.
- **Deadlines**: Set and track deadlines for your internship applications, so you never miss an opportunity.

In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and efficiency**. Thus, _LetsGetHired_ is
**optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, but you still enjoy the advantages of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you are a swift typist, _LetsGetHired_ can streamline your internship tracking **faster than many standard
GUI-based tools available.**

**_LetsGetHired_ is perfect for you if you are a Computer Science undergraduate student.**

command ensures you can effortlessly pinpoint the relevant records.

##### Command Usage

```

##### Parameters:

<box type="important" seamless>

At least **one** of the optional parameters must be provided.
</box>

1. **n/COMPANY_NAME** (Optional): Represents the company's name you're trying to search for.
1. **r/ROLE** (Optional): Refers to the specific internship role you wish to locate.
1. **c/CYCLE** (Optional): Identifies the internship cycle (e.g., `Summer`, `Winter`) you want to search for.
1. **s/STATUS** (Optional): Helps filter applications based on their current status.
1. **d/DEADLINE** (Optional): Locates applications by their deadline.
1. **i/NOTE** (Optional): Searches applications based on specific notes attached to them.

**Note about `find` command:**

1. **Partial Matches**: The `find` command is robust and recognizes partial matches. So, if you search for `Apl`, it'll show applications for `Apple`, `apple`, and even `Alphabet Limited`. 
    <box type="warning" seamless>

    **Exception**: Partial Match does not work on `STATUS` parameter. You need to specify the full `STATUS` to search for them.
    </box>

1. **Multiple Criteria**: By adding multiple parameters, you can refine your search further. For instance, `find n/Google c/Summer s/Pending` would display applications that meet **ALL** the following criteria:
    * Company name contains `Google`
    * Cycle contains `Summer`
    * Status is `Pending`

</box>

This feature is particularly useful when you need a more refined list or when you're unsure about the exact details but remember a few keywords.
