### Project: LetsGetHired

_LetsGetHired_ is a **desktop application** designed to assist you in efficiently **tracking and managing your
internship applications and their progress**.

In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and efficiency**. Thus, _LetsGetHired_ is
**optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, but you still enjoy the advantages of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you are a swift typist, _LetsGetHired_ can streamline your internship tracking **faster than many standard
GUI-based tools available.**

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New feature**: Added the command `NoteCommand` and its parser `NoteCommandParser` [#57](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/57)
  * _What it does_: Adds a note to an internship application or deletes a note from an internship application
  * _Justification_: Allows users to write notes to include background information on the company
  * _Highlights_: Has been further improved by other developers to have separate commands for note addition and deletion

* **Enhancements to existing feature**: Improved the command `FindCommand` and its parser `FindCommandParser` [#82](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/82)
  * _What it does_: Finds all internship applications that match either of the keyword and prefix pairs entered
  * _Justification_: Allows users to search for internship applications easily by any value for any of the fields
  * _Highlights_: Was initially implemented to search for internship application only by company name
