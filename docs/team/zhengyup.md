### Project: LetsGetHired

LetsGetHired is a desktop application designed to assist in efficiently tracking and managing internship 
applications and their progress. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
This project is a collaborative effort built with Agile methodology and comprehensive testing.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* New Feature: View : Added the ability to select and view a specific internship application.
  * What it does : Allows the user to select a specific intern application from the application list through 
    either the CLI or GUI, and view the in-depth details of the application in the select view. 
  * Justification : This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to have a 
    clear and organised view of an application's details without having to perform any formatting. This is 
    a significant user experience improvement from viewing details from the list view, and facilitates 
    other core features like adding notes to an application, which requires more screen space to render. 
  * Highlights : This enhancement required consideration of the layout of the user interface. 
* New Feature : Undo : Added the ability to undo previous commands.
  * What it does : allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time, up to the time the 
    app was started. 
  * Justification : This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes 
    in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them. This makes the app more 
    user-friendly as it reduces the destructive nature of some commands such as delete and clear.
  * This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an 
    in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
  * Credits : Sampled the proposed implementation of the undo/redo in AB3, which suggested the creation of 
    a Versioned extension of the InternTracker class which allows committing and undoing changes, but 
    decided against adopting the proposed data structure to manage version control.
